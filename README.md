’m excited to share my latest project where I analyzed and visualized weather data using Python (Pandas & Matplotlib) and Power BI.

🔍 What I did:

Cleaned and prepared real-world weather data

Created insightful visualizations for temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard for dynamic exploration of weather patterns

📊 Tools used:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Power BI Desktop

💡 Why it matters:
Understanding weather patterns helps in better planning and decision-making for businesses and communitines

Would love to hear your thoughts and feedback!
